# LightGBM

LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework developed by Microsoft that uses tree-based learning algorithms. It's designed to be distributed and efficient with faster training speed, higher efficiency, lower memory usage, and better accuracy.

## Key Features

- **Faster training speed** and higher efficiency
- **Lower memory usage**
- **Better accuracy** than other boosting frameworks
- **Support for parallel, distributed, and GPU learning**
- **Capable of handling large-scale data**

## Microsoft's Innovation

LightGBM uses a novel technique called Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) which allows it to achieve faster training speed and higher efficiency while maintaining accuracy.
