# PyTorch

PyTorch is Facebook's open-source deep learning framework that has gained massive popularity in the research community due to its dynamic computation graphs and intuitive Python-first design. It provides maximum flexibility and speed for deep learning research and production.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic computation graphs** - Define-by-run approach
- **Pythonic** - Natural Python integration and debugging
- **Strong GPU acceleration** - Seamless CUDA integration
- **Research friendly** - Preferred by many researchers
- **Production ready** - TorchScript for production deployment

## Facebook's Innovation

PyTorch's dynamic nature makes it particularly well-suited for research and experimentation. Its ability to change network behavior on the fly and excellent debugging capabilities have made it the framework of choice for many cutting-edge research projects.
