# ONNX

ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open standard for representing machine learning models. It enables interoperability between different machine learning frameworks, allowing you to train a model in one framework and deploy it in another.

## Key Features

- **Framework interoperability** - Move models between frameworks
- **Standardized representation** - Common format for neural networks
- **Broad ecosystem support** - Supported by major ML frameworks
- **Optimization tools** - Runtime optimizations for deployment
- **Hardware flexibility** - Deploy on various hardware platforms

## Enabling ML Interoperability

ONNX bridges the gap between different machine learning ecosystems, allowing developers to choose the best tool for each stage of their ML pipeline. Train in PyTorch, optimize with ONNX Runtime, and deploy anywhere.
