# Keras

Keras is a high-level neural networks API that makes deep learning accessible to everyone. Originally developed as an independent library, Keras is now integrated into TensorFlow as tf.keras, providing an intuitive interface for building and training deep learning models.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly** - Simple, consistent interface
- **Modular** - Easy to configure neural network building blocks
- **Extensible** - Easy to add new modules and functionality
- **Python native** - No separate config files needed
- **Multi-backend** - Originally supported multiple backends

## Making Deep Learning Accessible

Keras democratizes deep learning by providing a simple, intuitive API that allows you to go from idea to result with minimal delay. Its focus on user experience has made it the preferred choice for many developers and researchers.
