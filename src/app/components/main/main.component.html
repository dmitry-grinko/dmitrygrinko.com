      <h2>Hello! I'm Dmitry, documenting my transition from traditional software development to machine learning engineering.</h2>
      
      <div class="intro-content">
        <p>
          After years of building web applications and working with traditional software architectures, 
          I've decided to dive deep into the world of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 
          This blog is my learning diary and a resource for anyone taking similar first steps.
        </p>

          <strong>Why this blog might be useful for you:</strong>
        </p>
        
        <ul class="benefits-list">
          <li><strong>Beginner-friendly perspective:</strong> I explain concepts as I learn them, without assuming deep mathematical background</li>
          <li><strong>Practical approach:</strong> Focus on hands-on projects and real-world applications rather than pure theory</li>
          <li><strong>Developer's mindset:</strong> Bridging the gap between software engineering and ML with familiar programming concepts</li>
          <li><strong>Honest learning process:</strong> Sharing both successes and failures, common pitfalls, and "aha!" moments</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>
          Whether you're a developer like me exploring ML, a student starting your AI journey, 
          or simply curious about machine learning, I hope my notes and experiences will help 
          you navigate this exciting field more effectively.
        </p>
