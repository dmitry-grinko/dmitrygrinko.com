# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is Google's open-source platform for machine learning and deep learning. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that enables researchers and developers to build and deploy ML-powered applications.

## Key Features

- **Flexible architecture** - Deploy computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs
- **Comprehensive ecosystem** - Complete platform from research to production
- **Multiple levels of abstraction** - From low-level operations to high-level APIs
- **Strong community** - Extensive documentation and community support
- **Production ready** - Used by Google and many other companies in production

## Google's ML Platform

TensorFlow has become the de facto standard for deep learning applications, offering everything from research prototyping to large-scale production deployment. Its integration with Google Cloud makes it particularly powerful for scalable ML solutions.
